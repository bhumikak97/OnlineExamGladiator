		<p>
			<em>RUNTIME tERRORs</em> is a web portal helpful for companies or any
			organisation to conduct any examinations from this site and for
			students to attempt these exams. In this age of increased
			competition, various companies, organization's face a common problem
			of conducting online exam by personally visiting to different
			colleges (in case of companies) for placement drives. Manually going
			through thousands of colleges and conducting interviews requires a
			lot of time, efforts and money, this is the reason that most of the
			companies prefer visiting only top most colleges. The students of
			low-grade colleges despite of having the caliber to compete are not
			getting enough exposure to job profiles of their choices and end up
			getting a low satisfying job. To reduce this gap between these
			companies or any organisation and such potential candidates this
			platform will help the deserving candidates to showcase their
			conceptual skills through an online exam, based on which, the
			companies can filter out candidates according to their needs.
		</p>

		<p>Basically, we are providing an online exam system where we host
			exams to create report of candidates which can be viewed by the
			companies. This will not only help the companies or any organisation
			to analyse and select the cream candidates which meet company's
			requirements but also, help the students to get exposure to enough
			companies.</p>
